# S4.02IntroSpring-Nivell1

📄 Description

This is an introductory-level project using Spring Boot, designed to demonstrate how to create a basic application with web functionalities and database access using JPA.

 

💻 Used technologies

· Eclipse IDE 2024-03 

· Spring Boot 3.3.4

 

📋 Prerequisites

· Java 17 or higher 

· Maven 3.6+

 

🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
> git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
2. Navigate to the project directory:
> cd project-name
Build the project using Maven:
> mvn clean install

 

▶️ Execution

To run the application locally, you can use Maven or the jar file generated in the target folder:

With Maven:
> mvn spring-boot:run

Running the JAR file:
> java -jar target/filename.jar

 

🔑 Key Features

REST API: This project exposes RESTful endpoints to manage resources via HTTP.
Data Access with JPA: The project uses Spring Data JPA to interact with the relational database.

 

🌐 Deployment
To deploy the application to a production environment, follow these steps:

1. Build the application: Ensure the application is properly built by generating an executable JAR:
> mvn clean package

2. Prepare the environment:
· Make sure you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) compatible with Java 17 or higher.
· Set up a database (if necessary), and configure the application’s properties (like database URL, credentials, etc.) in application.properties.

3. Deploying on a cloud service or VM: You can deploy the built JAR file directly on a virtual machine or cloud platform like AWS EC2, Google Cloud, or Azure. Use the following command to run the application:

> java -jar target/filename.jar

4. Containerized Deployment (Optional): If using Docker, build the Docker image and run the container:
> mvn spring-boot:build-image
> docker run -p 8080:8080 your-image-name

Ensure that the container is configured to run in your desired cloud environment or orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes).

5. CI/CD Integration: For continuous deployment, integrate your repository with a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) that automatically builds and deploys the application upon commits or merges to the main branch.

 

🤝 Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/new-feature).
3. Make your changes and commit (git commit -m 'Add new feature').
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/new-feature).
5. Create a pull request.
